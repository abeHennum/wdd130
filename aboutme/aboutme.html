            <p>Hello everyone! My name is Abraham but everyone calls me Abe. I am currently studying computer science. I love to run, play soccer and hanging out with my friends. I recently got a job at a call center here in Rexburg. <!-- My favorite thing about byu idaho is hanging out with kassidy in her apartment.--> One of my favorite things about BYU Idaho has been going on hicking trips. I am excited to take this class and learn a little but more about computer programming and how it works.</p>
